    "Like much of mystical literature, this poem may be interpreted in different ways (depending on one's bias).",
    "One may imagine a rabble of drunkards entering a bar and singing this poem joyously.",
    "One may also interpret the praise of the 'loving gaze' as superior to the wine as the intoxication of two lovers (the drunkard and the bartender).",
    "Finally, one may interpret the bartender as God, the drunkard as the spiritual aspirant, the wine as divine bliss, and the intoxication as ego-death and ultimately merging with God."
