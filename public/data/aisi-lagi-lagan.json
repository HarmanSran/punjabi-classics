  "commentary": [
    "Meera (a.k.a. Mirabai) was a celebrated 16th-century Hindu Bhakti poet.",
    "Born into royalty, legend states that the young princess fled home and became a wandering mystic - seeking to connect with the loving Divine.",
    "One of the earliest references to her comes from medieval-era Sikh literature; the 'Prem Ambodh Pothi' (Book of Divine Love - c. 1693CE), a text attributed to Guru Gobind Singh (either written or patronized by) [1].",
    "In this text, Mirabai is remembered for her devotion to Giridhar (Krishna), revealed to be the form of the All-Pervading Divine.",
    "In the end of Mirabai's chapter in 'Prem Ambodh Pothi', her detractors eventually recognize her as One with the Divine - fully merged, without differences."
