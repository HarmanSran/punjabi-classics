  "commentary": [
    "Epitomizing the love-like connection of the Sufi aspirant to their Murshid, Guru, or Master.",
    "Like many qawwalis of this genre, there are many valid interpretations, depending on one's predisposition.",
    "However, what keeps a single interpretation is that the poem is an allegory for the underlying single-minded loving devotion to One.",
    "The 'Beloved' (the point of focus) is referred to with masculine language - yet feminine traits are frequently used (e.g. the veil) to describe It, adding delicate nuance."
